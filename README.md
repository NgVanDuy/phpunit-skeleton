# PHPUnit Skeleton #
_Get up and running with PHPUnit testing easily for your project_

Are you frustrated with trying to install and configure PHPUnit?

Are you wishing you could use just one command and BANG it was all done for you and you could get on with writing your beautiful unit tests?

Are you having sleepless nights or sleepy afternoons?

Well, I\'m happy to let you know that you just need to `clone` this repo and all your problems will be whisked away (apart from the last one, perhaps).

We have also included a sample class so you can learn a few tricks in how to use PHPUnit in your projects!
